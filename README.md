## About Me
Hi, my name is Emily Hyden. This is my 4th semester of the online MAMC program. I currently live in San Francisco, but I grew up in Gainesville and went to UF for undergrad. My hobbies include reading and writing, playing flute, guitar and singing, and rock climbing. I also love to travel: this year, I took two solo trips -- one to Rome and one to Mexico City. I am also planning a trip to Japan and South Korea in December!
## Past Coding Experience
I have 0 coding experience and am honestly quite intimidated by this class. I have enrolled and dropped it during drop/add a few times but can't put it off any longer. I worked on this assignment yesterday and had to scrap it and start over, so let's hope this second attempt is better! I am hoping to gain a basic understanding of coding and how it is even applicable to my career. 
## Career Goals
1. Own my own communications consulting firm
2. Oversee comms strategy for a major political campaign (and win) 
3. Be a trusted sage in my field and have an opinion that is valued
4. Retire young
